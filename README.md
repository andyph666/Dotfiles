This is an amalgamation of my personal dotfiles. I am running archlinux on vmware with i3-gaps.
Open-vmware-tools is working fine with copy/paste support, resolution change when resizing vmware, and shared folders.

This folder includes dotfiles for vim, tmux, i3, lemonbar, urxvt, zsh, conky, teamocil and more.

Send me an email to andyph666@gmail.com, if you need any help using these files. Thanks for looking!
