2016-01-15 20:12:49	anhtuann	The only thing I never know is how much to allocate for a root partition. I went with 20GB but don't know if it's overkill
2016-01-15 20:13:03	Bubo	Is there a way to check if you don't need some libraries? 
2016-01-15 20:13:16	zerol0g1k	20 is probably ok for most. mines 50, just to be safe
2016-01-15 20:13:17	Bubo	anhtuann, 20GB is fine
2016-01-15 20:13:27	MacGyver	anhtuann: This is one reason I always run my installs on LVM.

2016-01-15 20:15:07	zerol0g1k	dongerino 30 definitely would if you dont have a separate partition for your personal data, such as a separate /home

If you are certain that all UUIDs are correct and all filesystems are valid and supported, it may be because your BIOS Boot Partition is located outside the first 2TB of the drive [3]. Use a partitioning tool of your choice to ensure this partition is located fully within the first 2TB, then reinstall and reconfigure GRUB.

2016-01-19 00:40:21	schlerp	zerol0g1k: thank you
2016-01-19 00:40:26	zerol0g1k	but i dunno what flag it uses to make sure the output goes where it should
2016-01-19 00:40:27	schlerp	im just wondering about for the future...
2016-01-19 00:40:45	zerol0g1k	but -o sends it to the chat

2016-01-19 00:41:05	zerol0g1k	see
2016-01-19 00:41:17	schlerp	thanks zerol0g1k 
2016-01-19 00:41:40	zerol0g1k	schlerp znc has a control center module that you should be able to load from y our server configuration page and then access via any irc program
2016-01-19 00:42:01	zerol0g1k	from the control center module you can do a lot of shell-related stuff
2016-01-19 00:42:02	schlerp	zerol0g1k: awesome!!
2016-01-19 00:42:03	zerol0g1k	so if the exec option doesnt pan out, maybe the module will
2016-01-19 00:42:06	schlerp	thats what i was looking for
2016-01-19 00:42:33	zerol0g1k	schlerp: righto :)
2016-01-19 00:42:33	schlerp	i actually asssumed i was going to be able to call commands like ""/znc do this" "/znc do that"

2016-01-19 00:43:14	zerol0g1k	 youll have to check the docs for the exact commands to interface with the control center module
